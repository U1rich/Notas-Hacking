## Description
Can you figure out what is in the `eax` register at the end of the `main` function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: `picoCTF{n}` where `n` is the contents of the `eax` register in the decimal number base. If the answer was `0x11` your flag would be `picoCTF{17}`. Disassemble [this](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/512/debugger0_a).

## Hints
1. gdb is a very good debugger to use for this problem and many others!
2. `main` is actually a recognized symbol that can be used with gdb commands.

End of assembler dump.
(gdb) 

```
Se ve claramente que en eax simplemente se guarda 0x86342 y su equivalente en decimal es 549698.
## Flag
picoCTF{549698}
